    <div class="textmeditation">MEDITATION THEORY</div>
    <div class="hinh"><img src="../img/thien1.webp" alt=""></div>
<div class="texttext">
    <i>"Close your eyes and don't think about", "include music and relaxation" are the most common ideas about what Zen is. Looks like a view of most people and about the purpose of meditation, and in the question: "Why do you need to meditate" - many people do not think about: "To relax and calm down."
        <br><br>
        On the internet you can find a description of countless practices offered under the name of "meditation", but with nothing to do with it. In this term is now understood by anything - concentration, affirmation, relaxation, etc.</i>
</div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>WHAT IS MEDITATION?</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    To get an idea of what Zen really is, one can study a Buddhist text such as "The Sutra on the Holistic Actions and the Dharma of the Bodhisattva's Holistic Wisdom." This is quite an extensive text text, most of which describes the exact practice of meditation. And everything that is described there, you need to visualize and feel in your inner world. To at least approach all this, you need almost phenomenal memory, and in order to reproduce, you need to have a fairly developed spatial thinking. And this is one of the serious meditation practices, to master the units that are capable.
<br><br>
    Of course, there are many simpler meditation practices, but they do not fit the description "Close your eyes and don't think about". Meditation in Yoga is indicated by a term like "Dhyana", which literally translates as 'contemplation', 'Mind's vision' or 'Intuitive vision'.
<br><br>
As for most practices, popular on the Internet, it is most likely about concepts such as "Pratahara" - emotional control - and "Dharan" - a steady concentration on the object. According to the eight-step yoga system, which Patanjali describes, these two practices are preliminary and only in the process leading to their development, in fact, to meditation - Dhyan.
</div>
<div class="hinh"><img src="../img/thien2.jpeg" alt=""></div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>WHY DO YOU NEED TO MEDITATE?</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    Now, as we sort out the concepts, we will try to understand what meditation gives the broad meaning of the word and why you need to meditate. The phenomenon described below on the physical and mental and spiritual levels takes place both in the case of the practice of Dhyana and, in one way or another, in the case of the practice of PratyaHara and Dharana. And strangely enough, it does not depend on the complexity of the practice, but on the level of its development and integration.
<br><br>
-Meditation is not a religious ritual, but a real self-development tool. <br>
-Meditation affects cognitive function. <br>
-Meditation is an effective means against stress. <br>
-Meditation is more effective than morphine. <br>
-Meditation reduces the risk of heart attack. <br>
-Meditation - exercise of the mind. <br> <br>
Let's consider in more detail the main positive aspects of meditation and will try to determine what meditation is - a religious-esoteric practice or a real tool to change your life available for everyone
</div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION - POWERFUL SELF - DEVELOPMENT TOOL</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    The misconception is common that meditation is a purely religious practice, and that it is only suitable for certain requirements, the yogin, who has renounced the world, is wrapped in safran, and has nothing but Nirvana notorious, uncaring. But this is a different pattern.
<br><br>
Nowadays, practicing meditation many people have succeeded in worldly life. One of the most prominent examples is Steve Jobs, who practiced all kinds of serious meditation from the tradition of Zen Buddhism.
<br><br>
Therefore, meditation practices today have entered the lives of many people, and the trend in this regard is very occupied. For many people today to meditate - it is also natural how to charge in the morning. Actually, this is charging, just not for the body, but for the mind.
</div>
<div class="hinh"><img src="../img/thien3.webp" alt=""></div>
<div class="texttext">
    But also on the physical body, meditation also affects the most radical way. Research in this area shows that meditation has real therapeutic effects. For example, just ten minutes of meditation can reduce beta wave levels in the brain. In simple language, the brain less actively processes incoming information and such a decrease in activity allows peace on the physical and mental level. <br><br>
</div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION AFFECTS COGNITIVE FUNCTION</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    In research, it has been found that meditation directly affects the development of memory and learning abilities, and also develops self-analysis, self-awareness and compassion. MRI images of the test showed that after eight weeks of meditation practice, the density of gray matter increased by a third.
Yang meditation's effects have also been documented in the neuroscience area. According to studies conducted in this field, meditation practices enhance the relationship between neurons, help improve cognition and the quality of information processing, and also speed up reactions.
</div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION-MEANS EFFECTIVE AGAINST STRESS</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    It is enough to meditate for just about half an hour to eliminate or at least significantly reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. This is based on studies aimed at studying the effects of meditation for stress.
<br><br>
Various studies in this field confirm that meditation also allows you to fight dependence. Perhaps this is due to the fact that meditation stimulates the production of dopamine - the hormone of joy. But any dependence is based on the desirable principle of obtaining the correct dopamine emission. Therefore, there is an alternative to artificial stimulation of natural dopamine emission. And this is the most effective method of combining dependencies when destructive method to get pleasure changes for a healthier person.

<div class="hinh"><img src="../img/thien4.webp" alt=""></div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION IS MORPHIA MORE EFFECTIVE</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    It was to such a sensational discovery that scientists of the Fake Forest Medical Center in North Carolina arrived. Fifteen subjects taught basic meditation practices, and then to the base of each device was attached, heating the skin up to 50 degrees.
<br><br>
    MRI studies were then conducted, which showed a difference between the pain felt during skin heating before and after meditation. Images of the corresponding brain parts showed that the strength of their pain was reduced by 40% and their subjective mental discomfort by 57%. And according to the author of the study Fadey Zheidan, the indicators are almost double the indicators of the action of morphine in a similar situation.
</div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION REDUCES THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    Such information was published by the American Cardiac Association on November 18, 2012. So, as assured by the ACA, according to the research results of Dr. Robert Schneider, M.D., meditation practices do reduces the risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart attacks by 48%.
<br><br>
The study enrolled 201 people with cardiovascular diseases. And it was noted that over a five-year period of meditation practice, subjects had almost twice as many strokes, heart attacks and heart attacks as compared to similar patients not practicing meditation.

<div class="hinh"><img src="../img/thien5.webp" alt=""></div>
<div class="textlon"><b><u>MEDITATION - TRAINING THE MIND</u></b></div>
<div class="texttext">
    So, what is meditation? As we may have been convinced above, this is not some obscure esoteric ritual, it is a completely useful tool for solving problems both on a physical and mental and spiritual level. God. This is not magic, not magic, it is the most common practice of the mind.
<br><br>
Just as we train our body with physical education, you should train and train the mind through meditation practices. There are many meditation practices, but the simplest is focusing on the breath. From the beginning, we discussed that formal concentration is not a meditation practice. But we will not once again delve into the analysis of concepts; What is more important is that such a device is called, that it works.
<br><br>
To begin with, it is desirable to choose a quiet, secluded place. Ideally it would be if you were meditating somewhere in nature. You also need to choose a time to meditate: You must have at least 30-40 minutes free, preferably in the morning clock (preferably before sunrise). This time is most favorable for spiritual practices.
<br><br>
So, it is enough to sit down with crossed legs (not necessarily in the lotus position, but it will be perfect), and it is important that the back will be straight. Then start breathing slowly and deeply, gradually lengthening your breathing. The secret of this practice is that our mind has a feature: it cannot focus on two things at the same time. And if we focus on the observation of breathing, an internal dialogue stops or, at least, a little bit of eating.
<br><br>
It depends on how immersed you are in the process of observing your breathing. If all your attention is attracted to breathing, then the rest of your mind simply will not be left behind. And if it turns out to achieve one hundred percent concentration on the breathing process, you will feel a deep calm, perhaps, perhaps, not even felt before in life; You will feel it yourself.
<br><br>
Next, stay in this state as much as time allows or as you wish. And these 30-40 minutes of practice will give you good charge and peace for the whole day. In addition, the practice can be repeated in the evening to calm down after an eventful event. And this will allow you to sleep peacefully and not disturb dreams. So, practicing in the morning and evening, you gradually get a state of peace not only in meditation, but also in everyday life. And this will allow you to live more efficiently and consciously, and therefore, much less painfully in terms of stress and difficulties.
<br><br>
The practice described is a basic one, but even it brings powerful effects. If you want to try something more serious in this regard, you can get acquainted with advanced practices on the website Asaneonline.ru. As we may have been convinced above, meditation leads to fundamental changes on a physical and mental and spiritual level. And meditation is not only the detention center of Indian Ascets, who applied to saffron and renounced the world. Today, meditation is a powerful tool for socially active and successful people leading a healthy lifestyle. And if it works, then why not use it?
